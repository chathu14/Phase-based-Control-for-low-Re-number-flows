# Phase-based-analysis-and-control

This is a repository containing MATLAB codes for the preprint:"Phase-based analysis and control of low Reynolds number aeroelastic flows" by Chathura R. Sumanasiri, Tulsi Ram Sahu and Aditya G. Nair

Phase Sensitivity: Contains scripts to calculate phase sensitivity, growth rates for negative and positive perturbations (with data), and optimal phase-based control 

Energy Transfer: Contains the script to calculate energy factor for both negative and positive perturbations

Movies: Contains movies for flow over a 2D NACA015 airfoil at Re = 1000 (Stable, Unstable, Controlled)
